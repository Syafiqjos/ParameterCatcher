# ParameterCatcher
Some application using parameter or argument to run other application to use its special property and feature. This program let you catch unknown parameter or argument from that application.

# Example
Let's say you have a application to open google chrome browser to use it incognito, kiosk and other unknown features (temp directory, user-agent, etc).
You want to get all the parameter used to open google chrome.

# How to use it ?
Just change the application target (chrome.exe) to ParameterCatcher.exe then run that application again. A small text file "output.exe" will appear contains all parameter used in the program. So you can explore more about that parameters functionality and it is up to you.

# Disclaimer
Please use ParameterCatcher wisely. You can do whatever you want because it is your own responsibility.
